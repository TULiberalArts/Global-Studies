    Jonathan Holmquist is a Spanish sociolinguist with particular research interests that include language and gender, theoretical issues in Spanish phonology and syntax, and language contact. His research has drawn on community based studies in Cantabria, in northern, and in central Puerto Rico. His most recent research has allowed him to extend his work to another geographical area, the “altiplano” in the region of Chimaltenango, in Guatemala.


    Under a Temple University Seed Grant Award and also an Internationalization Grant from Temple, Professor Holmquist is working on a collaborative project with Dr. Hana Muzika Kahn (also from the Department of Spanish and Portuguese), combining their backgrounds in sociolinguistics and comparative literature to study language contact in a bilingual community where Spanish and Kaqchikel Maya are spoken. The foci are both the sociolinguistics of language contact in the community and oral narrative traditions in Spanish and Kaqchikel.

  bio: >
    Damien’s research examines ongoing mutations of national and trans-national identity in Western Europe, and especially France and Germany. As a visual anthropologist and anthropologist of media, his research focuses especially on the role that mass media play in (re)configurations of belonging and “culture,” as the nation-state vacillates between Europeanization, globalization, and reconsolidation. 


    His first book (UToronto Press, forthcoming) examines how staff at ARTE—a self-consciously trans-national television channel located on the French-German border—went about crafting media intended to promulgate a trans-border and pan-European culture.  His second project focuses on the uses of media, and especially new media, by far-right nationalist political parties in Europe.


    Damien received his B.A. in International Studies from the University of Chicago (2003), and his Certificate in Culture and Media (2006) and Ph.D. (2011) from New York University."

  expertise: "Globalization, Labor and Labor Movements, Development, Political Economy, China, East Asia"
  bio: >
    My research and teaching concentrate on globalization, labor and labor movements, development, and the political economy of China and East Asia. More specifically, I am interested in the dynamism of global capitalism and the ways in which its transformations are reshaping the nature and landscape of work and employment, producing divergent forms of oppression and resistance, and recurrently creating its own crises at global, national, local, and shop-floor levels.


    Within this agenda, I have been pursuing four projects at the intersection of labor, globalization, and development studies:

    1. Labor politics and worker resistance in the Chinese automobile industry and in China more generally, along with the massive inflow of global capital and the particular approach of the Chinese state

    2. Precarious work and politics of labor regulation in China through an exemplary case of temporary agency work

    3. How the movements of capital interact with labor politics and local development through a comparative case study of the global electronics industry from China’s coastal region to its interior and to Vietnam

    4. China’s role in transnational regulation of labor standards.


    My first book, _[Inside China’s Automobile Factories: The Politics of Labor and Worker Resistance](http://a.co/0TjnrR0)_ (Cambridge University Press, 2015), explores the current conditions, subjectivity, and collective actions of autoworkers in the world’s largest and fastest-growing automobile manufacturing nation. Based on years of fieldwork and extensive interviews conducted at seven large auto factories in various regions of China, the book provides an inside look at the daily factory life of autoworkers and a deeper understanding of the roots of rising labor unrest in the auto industry. By combining empirical material with a multilayered analysis that moves from the shop floor to the national political economy and global industry dynamics, I develop a dynamic framework for understanding how labor relations in the auto industry and broader social economy can be expected to develop in China in the coming decades. The book has received two awards from the American Sociological Association, and has been reviewed favorably in leading sociology, labor, China and Asian studies, and social history journals.


    I am currently working on my second book project, which explores how the movements of capital interact with labor politics and local development through a comparative case study of the global electronics industry from China’s coastal region to its interior and to Vietnam. I received a B.A. in Sociology from Fudan University (China), a M.A. in Sociology from University of Warwick (UK) and a Ph.D. in Sociology from the Johns Hopkins University (US) in 2010.
