## Internships
Doing an internship is an increasingly important part of the college experience; they give students the opportunity to gain valuable applied experience and to make connections in professional fields they are considering for career paths. We work closely with the [Joyce K.

Students can pursue internship opportunities in a number of ways.

**Internships in the Philadelphia area** are excellent opportunities for to see global work being done locally. Opportunities exist to intern at a variety of different locations from Amnesty International to the Foreign Policy Research Institute and from Puentes de Salud to the U.S. Commercial Service, all here in Philadelphia. If you have questions about finding an internship, make an appointment with the Global Studies advisor by emailing us at [globalstudies@temple.edu](mailto:globalstudies@temple.edu). We can talk to you about how to get credit for an internship by enrolling in GBST 3085.
