Global Studies Program has four funding opportunities available to members of the Temple community. Some enable student groups and faculty members to host global events at Temple, while the others help students to go global either through research or studying abroad.

##  Global Scholar Grant

The Global Scholar Grant is available to undergraduate Global Studies majors to help fund their study abroad experiences. Awards may include:

- Up to $1,500 for summer programs
- Up to $3,000 for a semester abroad
- Up to $5,000 for an academic year abroad

A limited number of scholarships will be awarded, and awards will be allocated based on merit and need.

## Regional Enrichment Scholarship

As a component of the Global Studies degree, majors are required to fulfill a regional enrichment requirement, which is designed to provide students with expertise in a specific geographic region of the world to complement the global, thematic focus of the major. This scholarship is aimed at students who opt to undertake a study abroad experience of at least six weeks and six credits to fulfill their regional enrichment requirement.

To be eligible to apply, applicants must be enrolled as full-time undergraduates in the Global Studies major, have demonstrated financial need, and have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. All Global Studies majors in good standing who meet these criteria are encouraged to apply.

To apply, students must complete the attached form. All applications should be sent in PDF or Word format to globalstudies@temple.edu. Questions about the scholarship should be directed to Danielle Scherer, the Assistant Director of Global Studies, at danielle.scherer@temple.edu.

## Student Organization Grants

As an interdisciplinary program with both global and regional components, the Global Studies Program seeks to support CLA-affiliated student organizations, both graduate and undergraduate, in undertaking activities with an international or global focus, including speakers, workshops, conferences, performances, film screenings, field trips, and other activities. Any College of Liberal Arts-affiliated student organization may apply for grants of up to $1,000.

Applications should consist of a brief (one-page) description of the proposed global or internationally-oriented activities, together with a detailed budget of costs as well as any available co-funding from other sources. Preference will be given to proposals with anticipated or (preferably) confirmed co-financing from other departments, programs, or outside sources of funding.

All applications are due by March 15th for the following academic year, and award announcements will be made by April 15th. All funds must be spent in their entirety during the period of July 1st through June 30th.

Applications may be sent to globalstudies@temple.edu. Any questions can be directed to Mark Pollack, the Director of the Global Studies Program, at [mark.pollack@temple.edu](mark.pollack@temple.edu).

## Graduate Student Research Grant

The Graduate Student Research Grant is available to graduate students in the College of Liberal Arts who are undertaking research that is international, transnational, or global in nature. These grants are intended to support graduate students in conducting original research that will be part of their dissertation or a project intended for publication.

College of Liberal Arts graduate students are invited to apply for grants to support research or data collection, including foreign travel for the purposes of archival research, interviews, ethnography, etc. Applicants may request a maximum of $3,000. Applicants must be enrolled students in good standing with their departments to be eligible. Students who have already benefited from a Global Studies Graduate Research Grant are not eligible to apply again.

Upon completion of their funded activities, all awardees will be expected to participate in the Global Studies Program in two ways: (1) by presenting a scholarly talk on their research after their return; and/or (2) by sharing their research experiences with Global Studies undergraduates in the Global Studies introductory course or in one of the capstone courses.

Applications should consist of the following:

- A cover letter including your name, TUID, email address, advisor’s contact information, and a timeline for the completion of the project
- An updated CV
- An abstract of no more than three double-spaced pages summarizing the research project, the specific research activities to be funded by the grant, and the contribution that these activities will make to your dissertation or other publishable research project
- A detailed budget showing how funds will be spent
- A letter of recommendation (sent directly by an advisor)

All applications and recommendations should be sent in Word or pdf format to [globalstudies@temple.edu](globalstudies@temple.edu). Questions about the grant should be directed to Global Studies Program Director Mark Pollack at [mark.pollack@temple.edu](mark.pollack@temple.edu). The deadline is March 15th each year for the following academic year and applicants will be informed of the decision by April 15th.

## Event Grants

Global Studies Event Grants are available to College of Liberal Arts faculty to host public events with an international or global focus, including lectures, speakers series, workshops, conferences, performances, and film screenings. All sponsored events must be public and open to all members of the Temple community.

Any faculty member (tenure-track or nontenure-track) may apply for grants of up to $1,000 for a single event such as a speaker, $1,500 for conferences and workshops, and $2,000 for ongoing activities such as speakers series.

Applications should consist of a brief (one-page) description of the proposed event or events, together with a detailed budget of costs as well as any available co-funding from other sources.

Preference will be given to interdisciplinary proposals with participation from more than one CLA department; to proposals which help to support ongoing communities of students and faculty; and to proposals with anticipated or (preferably) confirmed co-financing from other departments, programs, or outside sources of funding.

All applications are due by March 15th, for the subsequent academic year and award announcements will be made by April 15th. Funds will be made available starting on July 1st, and must be spent in their entirety by June 30th.
