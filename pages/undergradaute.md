The world is increasingly globalized, with goods, services, people and ideas traveling across borders more often, and more quickly, than ever before. Our interdisciplinary Global Studies program brings together coursework from across a dozen departments, focused on the study of global security, economy and cultures, and complemented by intensive language instruction and study abroad options.

## A Global Perspective

Gain advanced knowledge about international cultures and essential skills that are prized by every professional industry.

### International Opportunities

Our students have the opportunity to study and earn internship credit abroad at Temple’s campuses in Rome and Japan, as well as at dozens of other Temple-recognized programs.

### Language + Liberal Arts

The Global Studies major and minor link together social science and humanities courses with the advanced study of a foreign language.  

### Master the Global Economy

The global knowledge, language abilities and study abroad experience prepares students to enter the ever-changing, international workforce of the 21st century.

## Academic offerings

We offer a BA in Global Studies with specialization in one of three tracks: **global security**, **global economy** or **global cultures**.

The tracks allow students to identify a specialized program of study that draws from a structured set of requirements and electives, culminating in a research-based and writing-intensive capstone seminar.

We also offer a minor in Global Studies, available to undergraduate students in all schools and colleges at Temple.

## Funding Opportunities

Global Studies Program has four funding opportunities available to members of the Temple community. Some enable student groups and faculty members to host global events at Temple, while the others help students to go global either through research or studying abroad.

### Global Scholar Grant

The Global Scholar Grant is available to undergraduate Global Studies majors to help fund their study abroad experiences. Awards may include:

- Up to $1,500 for summer programs
- Up to $3,000 for a semester abroad
-Up to $5,000 for an academic year abroad

A limited number of scholarships will be awarded, and awards will be allocated based on merit and need.

As a component of the Global Studies degree, majors are required to fulfill a regional enrichment requirement, which is designed to provide students with expertise in a specific geographic region of the world to complement the global, thematic focus of the major. This scholarship is aimed at students who opt to undertake a study abroad experience of at least six weeks and six credits to fulfill their regional enrichment requirement.

To be eligible to apply, applicants must be enrolled full-time as undergraduates in the Global Studies major, have demonstrated financial need, and have a minimum cumulative GPA of 3.0. All Global Studies majors in good standing who meet these criteria are encouraged to apply.

To apply, students need to complete the attached form. All applications should be sent in PDF or Word format to globalstudies@temple.edu.  Questions about the scholarship should be directed to Danielle Scherer, the Assistant Director of Global Studies, at danielle.scherer@temple.edu.
