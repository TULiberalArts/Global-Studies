We offer a BA in Global Studies with specialization in one of three tracks: **global security**, **global economy** or **global cultures**.

The tracks allow students to identify a specialized program of study that draws from a structured set of requirements and electives, culminating in a research-based and writing-intensive capstone seminar.

We also offer a minor in Global Studies, available to undergraduate students in all schools and colleges at Temple.
