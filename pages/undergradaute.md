We offer a [BA in Global Studies](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/global-studies/) with specialization in one of three tracks: **global security**, **global economy** or **global cultures**.

The tracks allow students to identify a specialized program of study that draws from a structured set of requirements and electives, culminating in a research-based and writing-intensive capstone seminar.

We also offer a [minor in Global Studies](http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/global-studies/minor-global-studies/), available to undergraduate students in all schools and colleges at Temple.

## Coursework

All Global Studies majors begin with a combination of four introductory courses, as a gateway to the major:

- Global Studies 2096: Introduction to Global Studies (WI)
- Political Science 1301: International Politics
- Economics 1101: Macroeconomic Principles
- History 2819: Global Connections

From here, you can select one of the three thematic tracks to become the focus of their major. Students also complete at least two years of foreign language instruction, as well as a Regional Enrichment program — an approved study abroad program or coursework focusing on a region of interest.

A writing-intensive senior capstone research seminar brings it all together, with a research paper of your choice on a topic relevant to your chosen thematic track.

## Specialization Tracks

### Global Security

Today’s world faces a raft of potential security threats, from the rise of new great powers to international terrorism, weapons proliferation, cyber warfare, and the possibility of new global epidemics, among others. Students in the Global Security track have access to dozens of courses from multiple disciplines including history, political science, anthropology, geography and criminal justice, helping to understand the causes of war, security strategies of states and the rise of new and challenging security threats – especially as they relate to domestic and non-state actors – in a constantly changing global environment.

**Popular courses:**

- Superpower America
- Post-Cold War Security
- United States Foreign Policy
- 20th Century Europe: A Continent in Crisis
- Terrorism, Transnational Crime, and Global Security

### Global Economy

Economic globalization is one of the defining features of the contemporary world. This track focuses on the fundamental features of the global economy from multiple disciplinary perspectives, including in the areas of trade, finance, and development. It studies the origins and consequences of globalization for development and growth, income and poverty, literacy and health, as well as political, demographic, environmental, and cultural changes. Students examine the evolution of cooperation among states in managing the global economy, and the role of history, politics, and technology in shaping international, national, and local relations.

**Popular courses:**

- Economics of Development & Growth
- International Trade
- International Monetary Economics
- Urban Systems in a Global Economy
- Politics of the Global Economy

### Global Cultures

Globalization does not simply affect security and economics: Throughout history, different cultures have interacted and intermixed, sometimes peacefully and sometimes through imperialism and conquest. The Global Cultures track focuses not only on different national cultures, but also on what happens when cultures come into contact, and sometimes into conflict. Students in this track will examine the interaction of global and local cultures from the European imperialisms of the 19th century through the spread of Americanization in the 20th century to the ever-more pluralistic digital world of the 21st century, drawing on courses selected from a wide list of options in literature, film, religion, history, anthropology, religion, and sociology.

**Popular courses:**

- Fundamentals of Cultural Anthropology
- Introduction to Post-Colonial Literatures
- Imperialism, Race, and Empire
- Religion and Society
- Globalization: Causes, Promises, and Discontents
- Regional Enrichment Options

## The Global Studies Minor

Students may also take Global Studies as a minor, which includes the four foundation courses, together with three courses selected from one of the three thematic tracks. There is no foreign language or regional enrichment requirement for the minor.
