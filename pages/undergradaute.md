## Coursework
All Global Studies majors begin the program with four introductory courses as a gateway to the major:

- Global Studies 2096: [Introduction to Global Studies](http://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?search=GBST+2096 "Introduction to Global Studies") (WI)
- Political Science 1301: [International Politics](http://bulletin.temple.edu/search/?search=POLS+1301 "International Politics")

From here, you can select one of the three thematic tracks to become the focus of your major. Students also complete at least two years of foreign language instruction and a Regional Enrichment program—an approved study abroad program or coursework focusing on a region of interest.

A writing-intensive senior capstone research seminar brings it all together, with a research paper of your choice on a topic relevant to your chosen thematic track.

  <h3>Global Economy</h3>

    Economic globalization is one of the defining features of the contemporary world. This track focuses on the fundamental features of the global economy from multiple disciplinary perspectives, including in the areas of trade, finance, and development. It studies the origins and consequences of globalization for development and growth, income and poverty, literacy and health, as well as political, demographic, environmental, and cultural changes. Students examine the evolution of cooperation among states in managing the global economy, and the role of history, politics, and technology in shaping international, national, and local relations.

  <h3>Global Cultures</h3>
  <p>
    Globalization does not simply affect security and economics: Throughout history, different cultures have interacted and intermixed, sometimes peacefully and sometimes through imperialism and conquest. The Global Cultures track focuses not only on different national cultures, but also on what happens when cultures come into contact, and sometimes into conflict. Students in this track will examine the interaction of global and local cultures from the European imperialisms of the 19th century through the spread of Americanization in the 20th century to the ever-more pluralistic digital world of the 21st century, drawing on courses selected from a wide list of options in literature, film, religion, history, anthropology, religion, and sociology.
