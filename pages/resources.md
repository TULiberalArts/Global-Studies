# Coursework

The Global Studies major is a brand new, interdisciplinary major at Temple, designed to introduce students to the study of global affairs, combining bedrock instruction in multiple disciplines, a foreign language, and a world region, with specialization in one of three thematic tracks, allowing students to tailor the major to their own interests in particular issues and particular regions of the world.  Students may take Global Studies as a sole major, or as a double major alongside another, disciplinary major.

All Global Studies majors begin with a combination of four introductory courses, as a gateway to the major:

Global Studies 2096: Introduction to Global Studies (WI)
Political Science 1301: International Politics
Economics 1101: Macroeconomic Principles
History 2819: Global Connections

From here, students can select one of three thematic tracks to become the focus of their major:  Global Security, Global Economy or Global Cultures.

In addition, students will complete at least two years of foreign language instruction, as well as a Regional Enrichment program which can take the form of an approved study abroad program or coursework focusing on an area of the world in which you are most interested.

A writing-intensive senior capstone research seminar brings it all together, with a research paper of your choice on a topic relevant to your chosen thematic track.

## Areas of Specialization (Tracks):

Global Security

Concern for national security in an anarchic world has bedeviled the world for millennia, and today’s world faces a raft of potential security threats, from the rise of new great powers to international terrorism, weapons proliferation, cyber warfare, and the possibility of new global epidemics, among others.  Students in the Global Security track have access to dozens of courses from multiple disciplines including history, political science, anthropology, geography and criminal justice, helping to understand the causes of war, security strategies of states and the rise of new and challenging security threats – especially as they relate to domestic and non-state actors – in a constantly changing global environment.

Popular courses:

- Superpower America
- Post-Cold War Security
- United States Foreign Policy
- 20th Century Europe: A Continent in Crisis
- Terrorism, Transnational Crime, and Global Security

## Global Economy

Economic globalization is one of the defining features of the contemporary world. This track focuses on the fundamental features of the global economy from multiple disciplinary perspectives, including in the areas of trade, finance, and development. It studies the origins and consequences of globalization for development and growth, income and poverty, literacy and health, as well as political, demographic, environmental, and cultural changes. Students examine the evolution of cooperation among states in managing the global economy, and the role of history, politics, and technology in shaping international, national, and local relations.

Popular courses:

Economics of Development & Growth
International Trade
International Monetary Economics
Urban Systems in a Global Economy
Politics of the Global Economy

## Global Cultures

Globalization does not simply affect security and economics:  Throughout history, different cultures have interacted and intermixed, sometimes peacefully and sometimes through imperialism and conquest.  The Global Cultures track focuses not only on different national cultures, but also on what happens when cultures come into contact, and sometimes into conflict.  Students in this track will examine the interaction of global and local cultures from the European imperialisms of the 19th century through the spread of Americanization in the 20th century to the ever-more pluralistic digital world of the 21st century, drawing on courses selected from a wide list of options in literature, film, religion, history, anthropology, religion, and sociology.

Popular courses

- Fundamentals of Cultural Anthropology
- Introduction to Post-Colonial Literatures
- Imperialism, Race, and Empire
- Religion and Society
- Globalization: Causes, Promises, and Discontents
- Regional Enrichment Options

One of the most exciting opportunities for students at Temple and in the Global Studies major is the opportunity to study abroad in another country.  Study abroad is strongly encouraged for all Global Studies majors as part of the Regional Enrichment program, and advisors in the Office of Education Abroad and Overseas Campuses and the Global Studies faculty advisors will work directly with students to help identify the study abroad option that best fits with their foreign language choices, academic interests and career plans. Students can select a summer program (6 credits) or full semester (12-15 credits) option for this requirement.

Students may opt to study abroad at either of Temple’s international campuses in Rome or Tokyo. Students in these programs pay regular Temple tuition rates and receive financial aid. Full details on both programs are available [here]http://www.temple.edu/studyabroad/programs/index.html. In addition to these options, there are many other Temple semester and summer programs to choose from. Students are also permitted to study abroad through other, Temple-approved programs elsewhere.

Students who are unable to participate in study abroad because of personal obligations or financial limitations may select the Area Studies option to fulfill their Regional Enrichment requirement. In this option, students select two courses focused on the culture, development, history or politics of a world region of their choice.

For much more detail on the Global Studies major and its requirements, see the Temple University Undergraduate Bulletin, [here]http://bulletin.temple.edu/undergraduate/liberal-arts/global-studies/minor-global-studies/.

## The Global Studies Minor

Students also enjoy the option of taking Global Studies as a minor, featuring the four Foundation courses, together with three courses selected from one of the three thematic tracks.  There is no foreign-language or regional enrichment requirement for the minor.  For details, see the Temple University Undergraduate Bulletin, here.

## Careers in Global Studies

Foreign language proficiency and study abroad experience will also make Global Studies graduates attractive job candidates in a variety of industries, including business, civil service, government, education, law, medicine and health.

A bachelor’s degree in Global Studies prepares students to:

- Understand complex global problemsusing tools from multiple disciplines, including economic analysis, social science and historical methods.
- Communicate ideas about global issues effectively, through written work, oral expression and digital communication tools.
- Look beyond local and national boundariesto see themselves as part of a global network, the sustainability of which requires ethical and moral forthrightness.
- Experience other cultures, by studying a world language and participating in a regional enrichment experience such as study abroad.
- Thrive professionally in a variety of careers in an increasingly global marketplace.
