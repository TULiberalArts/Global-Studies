# Funding Opportunities

As the latest step in the globalization of the College of Liberal Arts, the Global Studies Program is a center of all things global at Temple. To facilitate the globalizing of the Temple community and its members beyond the classroom, the Global Studies Program has four funding opportunities available to members of the Temple community. Some of the funding opportunities enable student groups and faculty members to host global events at Temple, while the others help students to go global either through research or studying abroad.

The Global Scholar Grant is available to undergraduate Global Studies majors to help fund their study abroad experiences.  Awards range from $1,500 for summer programs to $5,000 for an academic year abroad. Find out more information about applying for this grant and upcoming deadlines.

The Global Studies Student Organization Grants are available to undergraduate or graduate student organizations that are affiliated with the College of Liberal Arts to help fund global activities both on and off campus.
