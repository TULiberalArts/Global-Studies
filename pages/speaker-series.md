**March 11, 1:00-3:00pm EST**<br>
**_What Makes Climate Change Colonial...and How Can it be Addressed as Such?_**<br>

Speakers:
- Tracey Osborne, UC Merced
- Kevon Rhiney, Rutgers University
- Kimberley Thomas, Temple University (Geography & Urban Studies), Organizer Moderator: Austin Martin, PhD Student (Geography & Urban Studies)

This webinar highlights geographical perspectives on climate justice that take contemporary climate inequities to be functions of historical and ongoing systems of oppression, exploitation, and marginalization. The panel draws on field experiences in several countries including Ecuador, Mexico, Jamaica, Vietnam, Bangladesh, Guyana, and the United States to consider how enacting climate justice is necessarily anticolonial and entails struggles over whose knowledge counts.

**_Populist and Far-Right Movements_**<br>

Speakers:
- Carly Barboza Machado, Universidade Federal Rural do Rio de Janeiro 
- Rohit Chopra, Santa Clara University
- Damien Stankiewicz, Temple University (Anthropology), Organizer

The last decade has seen a broad swell of far-right and populist political movements. Though they vary in form and content, some sparked by political leaders, others sprouting at grassroots, they tend to share a rejection of liberal values, pluralism, and democratic institutions. This event examines recent developments in India, France, and Brazil, taking special interest in how social media have intersected with the growth of far-right movements.
