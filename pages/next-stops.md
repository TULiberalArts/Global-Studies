When you major in Global Studies, you learn the skills, perspective and worldview necessary to be a top candidate for careers or graduate study in a variety of disciplines.

Foreign language proficiency and study abroad experience will also make Global Studies graduates attractive job candidates in an array of industries, including business, civil service, government, education, law, medicine and health.

**A degree in Global Studies prepares students to:**

- Understand complex global problems using tools from multiple disciplines, including economic analysis, social science and historical methods.
- Communicate ideas about global issues effectively, through written work, oral expression and digital communication tools.
- Look beyond local and national boundaries to see themselves as part of a global network.

## Study Around the World

One of the most exciting opportunities for students in the Global Studies major is the opportunity to [study abroad](http://studyabroad.temple.edu/). Study abroad is strongly encouraged for all Global Studies majors as part of the Regional Enrichment program, and advisors will work with you to directly identify the study abroad option that best fits with your foreign language choices, academic interests and career plans. Students can select a summer program (6 credits) or full semester (12-15 credits) option for this requirement.

Students may opt to study abroad at either of Templeâ€™s international campuses in Rome or Tokyo. Students in these programs pay regular Temple tuition rates and receive financial aid.

In addition to these options, there are many other Temple semester and summer programs to choose from. Students are also permitted to study abroad through other, Temple-approved programs elsewhere.

Students who are unable to participate in study abroad because of personal obligations or financial limitations may select the Area Studies option to fulfill their Regional Enrichment requirement. In this option, students select two courses focused on the culture, development, history or politics of a world region of their choice.
