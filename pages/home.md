The world is increasingly globalized, with goods, services, money, and ideas moving ever more quickly across borders. Knowing about the wider world is therefore no longer a luxury, but a necessity for  students preparing for life in the 21st century.The Global Studies program introduces students to the new, globalized world through the study of global security, the global economy, and global cultures from different disciplinary perspectives.
Through the program, Global Studies students develop international experience, foreign language proficiency, and the capacity to look beyond local and national boundaries. Additionally, the program fosters strong and effective interpersonal communication skills, deep understandings of the institutions and processes that shape the world, and interdisciplinary research skills preparing them for global careers.
